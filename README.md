# AR-Application
1：Creativity and conception: 
This is an interesting AR interactive Android application for popular science. 
Although modern people have the consciousness of protecting cultural relics, many cultural relics are not necessarily known before them. We just want to make use of our strengths to make cultural relics interesting and appear in front of everyone, so that cultural relics can not only lie in cold museums, but also appear in front of people in a trendy way. So I finally decided to do an AR popular science project about historical relics. 

2：The development platform of the work and the main technologies used: 
(1) It mainly uses Unity3D, Vuforia, 3Dmax modeling, Photoshop and other development platforms. 
(2) Vuforia realizes AR recognition function. 
(3) Unity3D realizes the functions of scene building, bronze model rotation, enlargement and reduction, question answer filling, judging right and wrong, button and so on. 
(4) 3Dmax is used to build the model, and some software such as BodyPaint 3D is used to map the model. 
(5) Photoshop realizes the optimization of pictures. 

3：The main function of the work 
In the first step, a topic will appear on the interface, and the corresponding model will appear after scanning the picture 
The second step is to answer the questions according to this model 
Step 3: If you answer correctly, you can enter the next level
